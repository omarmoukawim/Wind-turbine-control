# wind-turbine-control
The sampled and quantized control of the wind turbine has been developed during my Control of Energy Systems course that I have taken in my first semester of Master's degree. We had the complete mathematical model and by means of a PI control the overall system has been not only stabilized but made robust to noise introduced by wind too. Some parameters as wind velocity were considered unmeasurable and so they were estimated by means of a simple observer.
